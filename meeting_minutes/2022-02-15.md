## What is our relationship with GitHub?

* follow up on the discussion from
 [Discord](https://discord.com/channels/636084430946959380/642340762620657675)
 and [Discourse](https://discourse.llvm.org/t/migrated-bugzilla-content-and-header-names-angle-brackets/60089/)
* We can ask for features, but it's very uncertain if they will implement it.
* Roadmap is public, but it's hard to influence it.
* Maybe keep a global LLVM feature wish list as part of the IWG repo.

## Discourse migration

* What was the involvement of the IWG in the migration?
  * very little involvement
  * mostly driven by the board
  * however perceived by the community that the IWG was involved
* Do we want more involvement in such decision/migrations?
  * Yes!
  * tl;dr "Why have a working group if it's not involved?"
  * Help with project management and communication, especially handling negative, unhelpful feedback.
    * maybe split communication into a separate role as part of such a project
* Hiring a contractor would help a lot making progress on such efforts.
